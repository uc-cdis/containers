<h3>Gen3 PyStata Workspace</h3>

<h4>About</h4>

<h5>User license workspace</h5>
Users with their own active Stata licenses are encouraged to
use the bring-your-own-license Stata workspace.
This workspace is equipped to run Stata code in a Jupyter notebook
environment using a user-provided license.

<P>
As a one-time step, workspace users should add their license files
in their persistant workspace storage as
<pre>~/pd/stata.lic</pre>
The notebook has a few lines of python code to check for the
license file and copy it to the appropriate location so that Stata can recognize it.
</P>
