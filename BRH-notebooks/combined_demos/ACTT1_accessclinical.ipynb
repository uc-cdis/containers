    "The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. The primary analysis will include data from both severity groups using a stratified log-rank test. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19, an evaluation of the pooled (i.e., blinded to treatment assignment) proportion recovered will be used to gauge whether the targeted total number of\n",
