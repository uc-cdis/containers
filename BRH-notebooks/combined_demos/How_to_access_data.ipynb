    "# Data Access: Ways to bring data into the Biomedical Research Hub (BRH) workspace\n",
    "As a new user, you may be interested in exploring different ways to access data in BRH. In this notebook we will use some open access data to demonstate a few different ways to bring data into the BRH workspace and use the Gen3 SDK to download files: \n",
    "1. Using a downloaded manifest.json\n",
    "2. Open in workspace\n",
    "3. Downloading zip files using Gen3 SDK\n",
    "4. Using the gen3 SDK and GraphQL to explore data in a project\n",

    "# 1. Using a downloaded manifest.json\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Bring in open access JCOIN study \"OEPS\" into this notebook using a manifest file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite\n",
    "1. JCOIN Data Commons is Linked in the [BRH Profile Page](https://brh.data-commons.org/identity)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to download manifest file\n",
    "1. Go to the [BRH Discovery page](https://brh.data-commons.org/) \n",
    "2. In the \"Search studies by keyword\" box, type OEPS. The OEPS study details are listed below:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\t STUDY NAME = Methodology and Advanced Analytics Resource Center, \n",
    "\t\t FULL NAME = Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS), \n",
    "\t\t ID Number = 1U2CDA050098-01_b, \n",
    "\t\t Data Commons = JCOIN\n",
    "3. Select the study by clicking the check box on the left for OEPS.\n",
    "4. Click \"Download\" button to download the manifest file\n",
    "5. To bring the downloaded manifest.json into this workspace, upload the file using the \"Upload Files\" up arrow under jupyter \"Run\". *[Reference help link](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html#uploading-and-downloading)* \n"
