    "Over 800,000 people have died from drug overdoses since 1999 ([ref](https://wonder.cdc.gov/)). The estimated population with **Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)** is over **2.1 million** in the United States ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553166/)). Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, this opioid crisis has worsened with an estimated **100,306 drug overdose deaths** in the US during the 12-month period ending in April 2021, which is an increase of 28.5% from the 78,056 deaths during the same period the year before ([ref](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the adverse consequences of this opioid crisis, strategies, such as improving access to overdose reversal and medication for addiction treatment, are emerging at the state and local level in the US. **Medication for OUD treatment (MOUDs)**, including **methadone hydrochloride, buprenorphine hydrochloride, and extended-release\n",
    "naltrexone hydrochloride**, have been clinically proven to be effective at reducing opioid use and adverse outcomes ([ref](https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/medications-counseling-related-conditions#opioid-dependency-medications)). In this notebook, we will assess the MOUD capacity at the state  and county levels across the US, and identify the high risk counties with high drug related death rate and low MOUD accessibility, using the data from [project Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS)](https://jcoin.datacommons.io/JCOIN-OEPS). The OEPS data is created and led by the Healthy Regions and Policies Lab at University of Chicago, part of the Methodology and Advanced Analytics Resource Center (MAARC)\n",

    "* The map of high risk counties (high drug-related death rate and low MOUD capacity) show a huge cluster of high risk counties in the southwest area of the Appalachian region (**Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia**). \n",
    "* In the south-central region of US, **Oklahoma** is the leading state with the highest number of high risk counties.\n",
    "* Higher density of high risk counties is also observed in East North Central states, such as **Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio**.\n",

    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "* This analysis revealed noteworthy disparities between drug-related death rate and MOUD treatment capacity in **the Appalachian region, south region, and pacific region of the United States**.\n",
    "* Over 80% of the counties don't have any methadone providers. Half of the counties in the US don't have any moud providers. \n",
    "* Both methadone and buprenorphine have shown promising results as an opioid addiction maintenance medication in clinical trials. However, we've seen low accessibility of providers for both medications, especially methadone, across the states. \n",
