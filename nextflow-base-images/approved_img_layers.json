* The `get_layer_info_for_nf_imgs.yml` GitHub workflow reads the `nextflow-base-images/allowed_base_images.txt` file and populates this `approved_img_layers.json` file with layer information for each base image.
* You are reading a placeholder file. The current list of approved layers can be found at `https://github.com/uc-cdis/containers/blob/store/branch_to_track_nf_img_layers/nextflow-base-images/approved_img_layers.json`.
* The workflow currently assumes that only ECR images are in the list of approved base images.
