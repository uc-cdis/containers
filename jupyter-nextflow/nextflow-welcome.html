<h1 class=header>Welcome to the Nextflow Workspace</h1>
<div class=content>
  <p><strong>This is your personal workspace. The "pd" folder represents your
      persistent drive:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The files you save here will still be available when you come back
      after terminating your workspace session.
    <li>Any personal files outside of this folder will be lost.
  </ul>
  <h2 class=header>Get started with Nextflow</h2>
  <p>If you are new to Nextflow, visit <a
      href=https://www.nextflow.io>nextflow.io</a> for detailed information.
  </p>
  <p>This workspace is set up to run Nextflow workflows in AWS Batch. Your
    Nextflow configuration must include the Batch queue, IAM role ARN and work
    directory that were created for you automatically. The sample configuration
    file will allow you to run simple workflows and can be adapted to your
    needs. To get started:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you want your files to persist, first navigate to the "pd" folder.
    <li>Open a new "Launcher" tab and open a terminal.
    <li>You can find your sample configuration file in the "data" directory.
      Copy it to a new "nextflow.config" file by running this command in the
      terminal: <code>cp
      ./data/sample-nextflow-config.txt ./nextflow.config</code>
    <li>Launch a Hello World workflow by running this command in the terminal:
      <code>nextflow run hello</code>
  </ul>
</div>
